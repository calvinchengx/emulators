# The documentation site, and nothing else. Every other repository in this
# family drives its everyday workflow through a Makefile; this one has no
# emulator to run, so this file exists for the one thing it does have. The
# answer to "how do I preview the docs site?" is then the same in all eight.
#
# `pnpm docs:dev` is the fast inner loop for PROSE, and it is not this. It is
# based at the docs subpath and knows nothing about the tree around it, so
# under it the landing page does not exist, the redirect stubs do not exist,
# and site-data.json does not exist, so every number on the page shows as an em
# dash. Use it to write a page; use `make docs-serve` before believing the site
# works.
#
# CI runs `make docs-build` and publishes exactly what it leaves in ./_site, so
# the thing previewed here is the thing that deploys.
#
# Not called `docs`: there is a docs/ DIRECTORY here, and a target sharing its
# name is satisfied by the directory existing, so `make docs` would print
# "nothing to be done" and exit 0. .PHONY below would also fix it; a name that
# cannot collide fixes it whether or not anyone remembers .PHONY.
